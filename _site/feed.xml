        <title>Colorado Trail Thru Hike</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C_9Xz_r9EkI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
408 miles &lt;br /&gt;
15 days &lt;br /&gt;
8 lb base weight &lt;br /&gt;
4000 cals/day &lt;br /&gt;
3 toe blisters &lt;br /&gt;
Countless jaw drops in the San Juans &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a summer off in between my last two semesters in college seemed like a perfect opportunity to venture on a thru hike. This being my first long solo hike, my main focus for this trip was to maximize the amount of time walking and hitting big daily miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original plan was to make it all the way to Durango. I was going up to pace hitting about 32 miles a day for the first six days, but accidentally going off trail and hitting snowy passes at the Collegiate West section led to me losing a considerable amount of time and made me reconsider my goals. I managed to make it to Silverton by hitting around 26 miles a day for the rest of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been one of the most rewarding thru hikes I’ve done and it was great meeting like-minded thru-hikers along the way. Hiking in the Sierras in 2015 gave me some big aspirations to come back there for a PCT thru hike, and now doing the Colorado Trail makes me want to do the CDT and experience the San Juans again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Zumbro 50 Miler race report (My first ultra!)</title>
        <description>&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/posts-photos/2017-04-10-zumbro50/zumbro1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Post Photo&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; height=&quot;500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;color:gray; font-size: 80%; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Photo cred: Kevin Chem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;pre-race&quot;&gt;Pre-race&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I was hungry to challenge myself with something different and fresh: &lt;em&gt;trail running&lt;/em&gt;. More specifically, I was fascinated with the idea of running a 50 mile ultramarathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had gotten a pretty bad knee injury just one week before running the Cape Cod Marathon in 2016. Things were really going south for me days approaching the race. I had spent four whole months training hard for a sub 3:30 finish just to have all my hard work go to waste. As I was recovering from my injury, I found the thought of training for another marathon too boring. I needed a new challenge to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;50 miles. What once seemed like an impossible distance started to seem feasible to me when I realized I had a lot of time to train. Having a relatively easy college course load this Spring, I was able to consistently run some 50-70 mile weeks. Because I had to train during winter months, most of my running was done in semi-icy pavement. I did get a few trail runs here and there once snow started to melt, but not as much as I would’ve liked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;race-day&quot;&gt;Race day&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nerves kicked in as I drove with my dad down to Zumbro Bottoms, MN. With most of my training being done on roads, I had no idea how my body was going react to hilly terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was happy I had picked this race as my first ultra. The atmosphere was incredible and after taking a peek at the food choices in the aid stations I was in awe. As I was waiting for midnight to come, it was getting really cold and I was getting angsty just sitting down near the start. I noticed the warm coffee at the aid station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s where I made my first mistake. I thought a little coffee wouldn’t hurt so I chugged a cup of decaf. Then I had second guesses as to whether I had fueled up enough and impulsively ate a handful Swedish Fish from the aid station. Swedish Fish and Coffee… definitely not a good combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;first-loop&quot;&gt;First loop&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/posts-photos/2017-04-10-zumbro50/zumbro2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Race start&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Race starts and I’m feeling pretty comfortable so far. I noticed the hills were tough but I was racing through them at a pretty comfortable pace. At around mile 8 everything started going south. I was having some growing pain in my stomach to the point where I felt like I was going to blow up. Reached the aid station at Mile 12 desperately asking for toilet paper. After taking care of business and hydrating I felt like I could run comfortably again but I wasn’t feeling great. Despite these pains, I thought I kept a pretty OK pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;second-loop&quot;&gt;Second loop&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this loop, I was in a really bad place, mentally and physically. What in the first loop felt like gracefully sauntering up the hills was now me crawling in pain. I kept telling myself that I wanted to be over. When I got to the 25 mile (halfway) point it seemed as if I should’ve been done with the race already. The only thing that kept my sanity was food at the aid stations and the inspiration I got from watching the 100 mile runners strolling like zombies. One of the race volunteers at aid station 2/4 had made some of the best chocolate chip cookies I’ve ever had. It felt unearthly chowing down cookies with the amount of fatigue I was in, but I later realized that I was not eating as much as I should. I finished this loop terribly. I don’t remember my splits exactly but I believe I finished this in about five hours where as the first loop I finished closer to three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;third-loop&quot;&gt;Third loop&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/posts-photos/2017-04-10-zumbro50/zumbro3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sunrise finishing up second loop&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how things started to get better. It’s as if I just got a sudden burst of inspiration and I wasn’t thinking about the pain anymore. Just getting into a state of flow and being happy that I was doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was finishing up the second loop the sunrise brought end to the eight hours of pure darkness. I finally got that tight headlamp off my face and appreciated the lush glows of orange and purple from the early sun. It was definitely like a everything changed in a switch. I saw my dad at the start of the third loop and he encouraged me to sit down and eat for a little while. I’m glad I listened to him because after hours of being stomach sit I was able to eat again. I sat down on a bench for ten minutes to chow down five pancakes, couple of hash browns, a cup of chicken noodle soup, and quesadillas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked the first hill as I waited for food to digest. Then bam! It was like pure flow from there. I felt better than ever, and was able to knock down this loop in four hours for a total finish time of 12 hours and 21 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving forward&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so shocked by how my mind felt so in control for the last part of the race. I felt so inspired running with other amazing people that while I was there I knew I wanted to do another ultra. I signed up for this year’s Voyageurs 50 mile race in July, and I might be doing the North Face Endurance Challenge in Wisconsin as well. Other plans include a section hike of the Colorado Trail in July and a Superior Hiking Trail thru hike in late August.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Scotland's Skye Trail: Portree to Duntulm</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mjk3KmEUm8I&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelsey is living in London this year so I decided to visit her during Spring Break. We made a trip out to Scotland for a 4 days and the Skye Trail seemed like the most scenic, yet accesible option for a quick backpacking trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This island had some scenery straight out of a fantasy dragon-land, but the weather was pretty brutal. The winds were so strong we had to bail out after coming up a mountain pass near the Storr  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no chance for us to survive the storm in a tent, we slept inside a castle dungeon. That was pretty rad.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Grand Canyon: Boucher-Tonto-Bright Angel Loop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With a 5 day window open during Thanksgiving break, I set out to hike a little loop in the Grand Canyon. All of the campsites were booked for the Rim to Rim trail, so instead I opted for an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thirty-something mile loop I did started out in Hermit’s rest, went down the canyon via the Boucher trail, traversed the canyon parallel to the Colorado River via the Tonto trail, and came back up via the Bright Angel trail. Highly recommend this as an alternative to R2R: very few people, amazing campsite at Yuma point, and beautiful side trips near the Colorado River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Corsica GR20 (Northern Half)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the early summer of 2016, I headed to Europe to visit an old friend and set to hike the northern half of the GR20 route in 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“GR 20 is a long distance trail that traverses Corsica diagonally from north to south. It is considered to be the most difficult of all the GR routes and one of the most beautiful mountain trail in Europe […] The northern part starts in Calenzana and stops in Vizzavona. It is the most difficult part, because of the steep and rocky paths, but it is also considered more beautiful.” – http://corsica.forhikers.com/gr20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
65 miles &lt;br /&gt;
7 days &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The John Muir Trail was my very first thru hike. Prior to the trip I thought I had no idea what I was doing and planned the trip excessively: I picked out a camp site for every night, typed up all my meals typed up in a spreadsheet, and studied weather patterns across the Sierras. I’m happy I overprepared for this hike, because I learned a lot about what it takes to plan for a backcountry trip, but the moment I stepped my foot on trail I instantly became aware of the simplicity of the thru hiking life. I experienced what it was like living simply: just walking, eating, walking some more, and sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing the John Muir Trail as my first long hike has spoiled me a lot. I don’t think you could easily find a well established route that is this remote and so dense with beautiful mountains. Every single day on the Sierras was epic to say the least. For a friendly hike for all experience levels, I think this one’s hard to top.&lt;/p&gt;
