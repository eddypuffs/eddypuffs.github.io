<h1 id="pre-race">Pre-race</h1>

<p>This year, I was hungry to challenge myself with something different and fresh: <em>trail running</em>. More specifically, I was fascinated with the idea of running a 50 mile ultramarathon.</p>

<p>I had gotten a pretty bad knee injury just one week before running the Cape Cod Marathon in 2016. Things were really going south for me days approaching the race. I had spent four whole months training hard for a sub 3:30 finish just to have all my hard work go to waste. As I was recovering from my injury, I found the thought of training for another marathon too boring. I needed a new challenge to look forward to.</p>

<p>50 miles. What once seemed like an impossible distance started to seem feasible to me when I realized I had a lot of time to train. Having a relatively easy college course load this Spring, I was able to consistently run some 50-70 mile weeks. Because I had to train during winter months, most of my running was done in semi-icy pavement. I did get a few trail runs here and there once snow started to melt, but not as much as I would’ve liked.</p>

<h1 id="race-day">Race day</h1>

<p>The nerves kicked in as I drove with my dad down to Zumbro Bottoms, MN. With most of my training being done on roads, I had no idea how my body was going react to hilly terrain.</p>

<p>I was happy I had picked this race as my first ultra. The atmosphere was incredible and after taking a peek at the food choices in the aid stations I was in awe. As I was waiting for midnight to come, it was getting really cold and I was getting angsty just sitting down near the start. I noticed the warm coffee at the aid station.</p>

<p>Here’s where I made my first mistake. I thought a little coffee wouldn’t hurt so I chugged a cup of decaf. Then I had second guesses as to whether I had fueled up enough and impulsively ate a handful Swedish Fish from the aid station. Swedish Fish and Coffee… definitely not a good combination.</p>

<h1 id="first-loop">First loop</h1>

<p><img src="/posts-photos/2017-04-10-zumbro50/zumbro2.jpg" alt="Race start" class="img-responsive" height="300px" /></p>

<p>Race starts and I’m feeling pretty comfortable so far. I noticed the hills were tough but I was racing through them at a pretty comfortable pace. At around mile 8 everything started going south. I was having some growing pain in my stomach to the point where I felt like I was going to blow up. Reached the aid station at Mile 12 desperately asking for toilet paper. After taking care of business and hydrating I felt like I could run comfortably again but I wasn’t feeling great. Despite these pains, I thought I kept a pretty OK pace.</p>

<h1 id="second-loop">Second loop</h1>

<p>During this loop, I was in a really bad place, mentally and physically. What in the first loop felt like gracefully sauntering up the hills was now me crawling in pain. I kept telling myself that I wanted to be over. When I got to the 25 mile (halfway) point it seemed as if I should’ve been done with the race already. The only thing that kept my sanity was food at the aid stations and the inspiration I got from watching the 100 mile runners strolling like zombies. One of the race volunteers at aid station 2/4 had made some of the best chocolate chip cookies I’ve ever had. It felt unearthly chowing down cookies with the amount of fatigue I was in, but I later realized that I was not eating as much as I should. I finished this loop terribly. I don’t remember my splits exactly but I believe I finished this in about five hours where as the first loop I finished closer to three.</p>

<h1 id="third-loop">Third loop</h1>

<p><img src="/posts-photos/2017-04-10-zumbro50/zumbro3.jpg" alt="Sunrise finishing up second loop" class="img-responsive" height="300px" /></p>

<p>I have no idea how things started to get better. It’s as if I just got a sudden burst of inspiration and I wasn’t thinking about the pain anymore. Just getting into a state of flow and being happy that I was doing this.</p>

<p>As I was finishing up the second loop the sunrise brought end to the eight hours of pure darkness. I finally got that tight headlamp off my face and appreciated the lush glows of orange and purple from the early sun. It was definitely like a everything changed in a switch. I saw my dad at the start of the third loop and he encouraged me to sit down and eat for a little while. I’m glad I listened to him because after hours of being stomach sit I was able to eat again. I sat down on a bench for ten minutes to chow down five pancakes, couple of hash browns, a cup of chicken noodle soup, and quesadillas.</p>

<p>I walked the first hill as I waited for food to digest. Then bam! It was like pure flow from there. I felt better than ever, and was able to knock down this loop in four hours for a total finish time of 12 hours and 21 minutes.</p>

<h1 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h1>

<p>I was so shocked by how my mind felt so in control for the last part of the race. I felt so inspired running with other amazing people that while I was there I knew I wanted to do another ultra. I signed up for this year’s Voyageurs 50 mile race in July, and I might be doing the North Face Endurance Challenge in Wisconsin as well. Other plans include a section hike of the Colorado Trail in July and a Superior Hiking Trail thru hike in late August.</p>
