Kelsey is living in London this year so I decided to visit her during Spring Break. We made a trip out to Scotland for a 4 days and the Skye Trail seemed like the most scenic, yet accesible option for a quick backpacking trip.


This island had some scenery straight out of a fantasy dragon-land, but the weather was pretty brutal. The winds were so brutal we had to bail out after coming up a mountain pass near the Storr  ¯&#92;\_(ツ)\_/¯. 

With no chance for us to survive the storm in a tent, we slept inside a castle dungeon. That was pretty rad.
