<!--<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/picture-profile.jpg" width="200" alt="image"></div><br>-->

<p>

My name is Ed, and I'm a student at the University of Minnesota graduating with a bachelors in Computer Engineering on December 2017. <br><br>

I'm a full stack web developer interested in writing back-end software. I also like to help software teams achieve high quality releases and better development productivity with automated testing tools and continuous integration processes.  <br><br>

I was previously a co-op for Medtronic and an intern for UnitedHealth Group. While at school, I worked for Carlson School of Management IT where I helped automate laptop diagnostics and computer lab installation procedures. <br><br>

I am well versed in Java, iOS development, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Bash (and am constantly adding to this list). I enjoy tinkering with Arduino boards and working on projects that inspire people to go outdoors. Check out my <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects"> project portfolio!</a><br><br>

Sometimes, I'll go <a href="{{ site.url }}/outside">outside</a> to run until my toes bleed or venture on overnight hikes. <br><br>

Here's my <a href="http://www.github.com/eddypuffs">Github</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nunez087/">LinkedIn</a> . If you'd like to contact me, feel free to shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:nunez087@umn.edu">nunez087@umn.edu</a>. Look forward to hearing from you!<br>
