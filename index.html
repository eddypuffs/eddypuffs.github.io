<div class="about-me"><br>
<p>

My name is Ed, and I'm a student at the University of Minnesota graduating with a bachelors in Computer Engineering on December 2017. <br><br>

I'm a systems developer interested in writing low-level code for device firmware and operating system tools. I also like to help software teams achieve high quality releases and better development productivity with the aid of Agile principles and continuous integration processes.  <br><br>

I was previously a co-op for Medtronic and an intern for UnitedHealth Group. I also worked at Carlson School of Management Information Technology where I wrote software that helped IT staff automate various workflows.<br><br>

I am well versed in C, Assembly, Java, Bash, Python, HTML, CSS and iOS development (and I am constantly adding to this list). I enjoy tinkering with Arduino and Teensy dev boards and working in projects that have a focus on audio. Check out my <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects">project portfolio!</a><br><br>

Sometimes, I also like to go <a href="{{ site.url }}/outside">outside</a> to run until my toes bleed or venture on overnight hikes. <br><br>

Here's my <a href="http://www.github.com/eddypuffs">Github</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nunez087/">LinkedIn</a> . If you'd like to contact me, feel free to shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:nunez087@umn.edu">nunez087@umn.edu</a> <br>
