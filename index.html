<!--<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/picture-profile.jpg" width="200" alt="image"></div><br>-->

<p>
My name is Ed, and I'm a student at the University of Minnesota graduating with a Bachelor of Computer Engineering on December 2017. I am actively looking for a full-time position starting the beginning of next year.
</p>

<p>
I'm a software developer interested in writing back-end software for the web and mobile. I also like to help software teams achieve high quality releases and better productivity with automated testing tools and continuous integration processes.
</p>

<p>
I was previously a co-op for Medtronic and an intern for UnitedHealth Group. While at school, I worked for Carlson School of Management IT where I helped automate laptop diagnostics and computer lab installation procedures.
</p>

<p>
I am well versed in Java, iOS development, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Bash (and am constantly adding to this list). I enjoy tinkering with Arduino boards and working on projects that inspire people to go outdoors. Check out my <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects"> project portfolio!</a>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, I'll go <a href="{{ site.url }}/outside">outside</a> to run until my toenails fall off or venture on overnight hikes.
</p>

Here's my <a href="http://www.github.com/ednunezg">Github</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ednunezg/">LinkedIn</a> . If you'd like to contact me, feel free to shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:ed@ednunez.me">ed@ednunez.me</a>. Look forward to hearing from you!
